                To anyone wondering why this website refers to Utkarsh (aka Chetan) in the third person, that's because the <span className="word">narrator</span> who is me thought it would be cool. Such a nerd. Sigh. Who am I you ask? I am someone who has had the pleasure to have known Chetan closely for almost seven years now and who has learnt so much from him that life without him is unimaginable.

                I coded this React website for his <span className="word">25th birthday</span> to portray how incredible his journey has been so far that it will be inspiring to anyone who comes across this over the internet, just like he inspires me every day.
                </p>

                <p>
                I wish him a really <span className="word">Happy Birthday</span>, and may he grow even more in his career, spend time with his family and closest friends and live each day to the fullest!
