        <h5>Utkarsh's <span className="word">Incredible Story</span> So Far</h5>

        <br></br>
            

            <p>
            Let's take out our time machines and head back in time. In his <span className="word">school</span> days, an extroverted Utkarsh was a popular kid who would play football, prank his friends, crack jokes and also get good grades. He was a naughty kid and his mother would have a cornucopia of stories about his childhood shenanigans.
            </p>

            <p>
            Soon he appeared for JEE Mains in 2014 and ended up pursuing <span className="word">Engineering in Computer Science</span> from a government college in Bhopal. But around the time when he was in his 2nd year, he realised he <span className="word">didn't enjoy coding</span>. He had spent time trying to develop his interest in Linux, C++, Algorithms and Data Structures. But nothing seemed to excite him.
            </p>

            <p>
            Around the same time, he started to develop a <span className="word">keen interest in entrepreneurship</span>. He enthusiastically brought together people and started a website <span className="word">The Veracity</span> which would host articles on various topics. He created the website on his own and would hire interns for the articles. He also handled the social media pages. He <span className="word">enjoyed</span> it and that's how his interest in entrepreneurship got cemented with this as his first product. He would later on in life try out various product ideas with his colleagues and friends.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Motivated to pursue his interests in businesses and startups, he appeared for <span className="word">CAT</span> in 2017 and got 96 percentile. As he wanted to study in one of the IIM-A, B or Cs, he decided to give it a second attempt sometime later.
            </p>


            <p>
            But now the <span className="word">real struggle commenced</span> in 2018 as he was fresh out of college with an Engineering degree in CS and he had to now find a job which would interest him. He hadn't appeared for the coding-related college placements as he wasn't interested in securing that job. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Even though he was feeling low being <span className="word">under intense pressure</span> and going through a terrible heartbreak, he still kept going and didn't give up. 
            </p>

            <p>
            His <span className="word">resilience bore fruit</span> when after taking online courses to learn Data Analytics, reaching out to countless people on LinkedIn, appearing for a plethora of interviews, he finally got an <span className="word">internship at Smartworks</span> as a Business Analytics intern. There he worked closely with the Founder and proved to be an asset to the company with his enthusiasm and hard work. He converted his internship to a full-time opportunity within three months and continued with his excellent performance.

            <p>
            It was now the year 2020. After two years of working at Smartworks, he started <span className="word">yearning for a change</span>. Amidst the <span className="word">COVID-19 pandemic</span>, he began his job hunt once again in search of an incredible startup which would challenge him and give him new learning opportunities. He sent out cold emails, spoke to countless people and gave many interviews. He kept trying and kept following up with people and finally landed an Entrepreneur in Residence role at the ed-tech startup CodeYoung.

            <p><span className="word" style={{fontStyle:"italic"}}>That's where he is right now! Wasn't it amazing? His journey is filled with him trying out new stuff, gauging his interests, failing at some, but excelling with flying colours in others! No matter what the situation is, he always manoeuvres through it with a smile. He still has so much more to achieve. His incredible journey has just begun. Onwards and Upwards, that's Utkarsh for you!</span>
